The goal is to find a location in which a cafe is likely to be successful, which will require identifying neighbourhoods in which one can find similar types of businesses, such as bars and restaurants; but preferebaly one that is not already saturated with cafes.\n\nWe can tackle this problem using geospatial data and machine learning teachniques."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data\n\nWe begin by acquiring the list of neighbourhoods and corresponding postal codes for Toronto from Wikipedia, then matching the postal codes to GPS coordinates.
